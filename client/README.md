## Client

The `/client` directory holds all static content that is related to the browser. Essentially this is a collection of client-side views or 'apps'. The server has access to these views and is able to render them in response to a request to a particular route.

Our `webpack.config.js` resides within the `/client` directory as this is the only part of the project that requires compilation.
